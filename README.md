## Getting Started

From your terminal, clone this repo and run the following in the project root:

```sh
npm install
```

To start your app in development mode and rebuild assets on file changes:

```sh
npm run dev
```

to build the app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
